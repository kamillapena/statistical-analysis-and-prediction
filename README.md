# 📉 Statistical Analysis & Predictive Modeling

This project explores fundamental statistical concepts and their application in predictive modeling using Python. It bridges the gap between probability theory and practical Machine Learning classification.

## 📋 Key Features
- **Probability Distributions:** Implementation and visualization of Normal Distribution, including Probability Density Function (PDF) and Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF).
- **Z-Scores & Standardization:** Calculating probabilities and identifying outliers in datasets.
- **Predictive Modeling:** - Build a **Logistic Regression** model to predict 'Mortality'.
    - Evaluation using **Confusion Matrix** (visualized via `ConfusionMatrixDisplay`).
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling train-test splits and feature scaling for statistical models.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Libraries:** Scipy (for stats), Scikit-Learn (for ML), Matplotlib & Seaborn (for plotting), Pandas.
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook.

## 🔍 Visualizations Included
- Normal distribution curves showing probability areas.
- Confusion Matrix showing True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives.
